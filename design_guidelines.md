# Badge Check - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**System-Based Approach**: Drawing from Material Design and civic technology platforms (GovTech services, legal tech interfaces), prioritizing clarity, credibility, and accessibility for a police accountability tool.

**Core Principle**: Create a professional, trustworthy interface that conveys transparency and reliability while remaining accessible for field use and urgent situations.
