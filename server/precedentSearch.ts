ISSUE: ${issueDescription}
STATE: ${state}
JURISDICTION: ${jurisdiction}

COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

1. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS (Highest Priority):

   - State-specific tort law cases
   - State constitutional claims

4. FACTUALLY SIMILAR CASES:
   - Cases with similar fact patterns
   - Cases involving similar violations

5. PROCEDURAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRECEDENTS:
   - Cases on qualified immunity standards
   - Cases on municipal liability standards
   - Cases on damages and remedies
   - Cases on burden of proof

For EACH case, provide:
- Full case name (proper Bluebook format)
- Complete legal citation (Bluebook format)
- Year decided
- Court name (full official name)
- Detailed explanation of relevance to current case
- Complete key holding/legal principle
- Important quotes from the opinion (if applicable)

PRIORITIZE:
- Binding precedent over persuasive precedent
- Recent cases over older cases (unless landmark)
- Factually similar cases over general principles
- Favorable holdings over unfavorable holdings

Provide at least 8-12 highly relevant precedents.`;

Now perform PRECEDENT VERIFICATION AND EXPANSION:

1. VERIFY EACH CASE:
   - Confirm case names and citations are 100% accurate (Bluebook format)
   - Verify years are correct
   - Check that key holdings are accurately stated
   - Confirm cases are still good law (not overruled)

2. EXPAND RESEARCH:
   - Find additional relevant precedents not in the first pass
   - Include more recent cases (especially from last 3 years)
   - Add more ${state} state supreme court cases
   - Include more factually similar cases

3. SHEPARDIZE:
   - Note any negative treatment of cases
   - Identify subsequent history
   - Flag any cases that have been distinguished or limited

4. PRIORITIZE:
   - Rank cases by relevance and favorability
   - Identify the MOST persuasive precedents
   - Note which cases are binding vs. persuasive

Provide at least 12-15 highly relevant, verified precedents in the same JSON format.`;
